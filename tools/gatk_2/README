The gatk2_sorted_picard_index.loc and gatk2_annotations.txt files must be
copied into the tool-data directory.  The file tool_data_table_conf.xml must
be edited to include references to these two new files.  

Additionally, copies of or links to the GenomeAnalysisTK.jar and key file
must be made within the directory tool-data/shared/jars/gatk2.

  cd ${GALAXY_DATA_INDEX_DIR}/shared/jars
  mkdir gatk2
  cd gatk2
  ln -s /path/to/wherever/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar .
  ln -s /path/to/wherever/key.file gatk2_key_file
