"""
A module to delete all cns- and xplor-type comments from any input file.
The following comments are thrown out:
    ! blabla until end of line
    # blabla until end of line
    {blabla}
    {bla{bla}bla}
Don't use (this will cause problems):
    {bla!bla}
    {bla#bla}
    
    
NOTE:
    -curly braces after '!' or '#' (until lineend) are not interpreted as the
     beginning of another comment
    -be careful: '!' and '#' within curly braces are interpreted as 'comment
     until lineend'.

EXAMPLE:
    this tiny cns script (let's call it test.cns):
        evaluate ($i = 1)
        {
        evaluate ($j = {2} 3)
        }
        {evaluate ($k = 4)}
        evaluate ($l = 5) ! braces like { after exclamationmark don't count
        display $i
        display $l
        stop
    can be parsed with:
    from DeleteComments import *
    GetFile('/home/linge/tmp/test.cns', '/home/linge/tmp/test.without')
    it will look like:
        evaluate ($i = 1)

                          
        evaluate ($l = 5)
        display $i
        display $l
        stop

    this example shows that linebreaks before and after the { bla } are not removed.
